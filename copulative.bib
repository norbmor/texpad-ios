Specifically, we claim that in copular sentences with adjectival complements, the different kinds of elements that build up the comparison class needed to evaluate adjectival properties can account for the IL/SL character of the predication and that, specifically, the IL/SL distinction is linked to the relative/absolute distinction. This proposal, together with the hypothesis that relative adjectives trigger by default an inference of temporal persistence, can account for all the aforementioned differences between ser `beSER' and estar `beESTAR' sentences. We thus argue for an extension of the explanatory value of the individual/stage-level distinction to the domain of gradability.},

Departing from an analysis that relies on two different types of stative predicates (stativity associated with lack of aspectual information and stativity associated with the subevent property state), we tested (i) children’s ability to calculate the permanent/temporary implicatures commonly associated with ser and estar and (ii) their ability to restrict the temporal domain of evaluation. We argue that our results are compatible with the idea that children do distinguish between the two copulas in an almost adult-like manner, but have problems when required to restrict the domain of evaluation of each copula, providing further support for the hypothesis that children have difficulties with domain restrictions.},

In Experiment 1, monolingul - s nf Spanish-speaking preschoolers participated in an a peprance-reality task in which Spanish speakers heard forms of the Spanish verb ser in place of the English verb ``is'' in the reality questions and forms of the Spanish verb estar in palce of ``is'' in the appearance questions. Spanish speakers performed reliably better than English speakers on the question about the real properties of less familiar objecrd. In Experiment 2, English-Spanish bilingual children participated in the same tadk used in Experiment 1. They answered half of the questions in English and half in Spanish. Bilinguals identified the real properties of objects reliably better in Spanish than in English, indicating that language can affect the ability to identify real properties. In Experiment 3, we examined the role of language in the ability of monolingual English-speaking 3-year-olds to identify real and apparent properties. These children answerd different type of appearance and reality questions, using the same objects from Experiments 1 and Half of the children answered standard appearance-reality questions; the other children answered elaborated versions of the English questions. Children in both conditions performed equivalently, suggesting that English-speaking children are not easily influenced by language in these tasks. Apparently, the advantage that the Spanish copual, ser, gives speakers of Spanish is important and unique because it cannot easily be instantiated in English.},

abstract = {Four studies investigated adults' uses and children’s acquisition of the two Spanish synonyms of to be, ser and estar. The first study consisted of a distributional analysis of ser and estar in Spanish spoken by children and adults. The results revealed that the copulas were used contrastively across different syntactic contexts. Forms of ser were used exclusively with nominals, forms of estar were used as auxiliaries and with locations, and both forms were used with adjectives. Study 2 documented a semantic difference between ser and estar with adjectives for adults such that adjectives that were labelled with ser were weighed more heavily than attributes that were labelled with estar in a categorization task. In Study 3, a semantic contrast between objects and events with locations in adults was empirically demonstrated. Study 4 examined the use of the Spanish copulas with adjectives and locations by Spanish-speaking children from 3 to 11 years of age. The findings from Study 4 suggest that Spanish-speaking children honored fewer semantic contrasts than adults, and that their uses have a more syntactic basis. The study’s implications for the structure of language and its acquisition are discussed.},

school = {Yale University}, 
address = {}, 
pages = {}, 
year = {2018}, 
abstract = {Recent investigations into the sources of language change have focused on identifying the systematic patterns of variation across languages and providing generalizations that may explain these changes. These systematic developmental paths in the meanings of expression may rely on cognitively relevant properties that facilitate changes in language. This dissertation aims to provide an understanding of these cognitively relevant sources of language variation and, ultimately, stable changes in language. This question is addressed by investigating the patterns of synchronic variation in Spanish copula use across four dialects. The motivation for this dissertation relies on two main observations from previous literature. The first is a synchronic observation pointing to variation in copula use across Spanish dialects. The second is a diachronic observation indicating that, over time, the domain of use of estar has been encroaching upon the domain of ser. What is the connection between synchronic variation in copula use and the observed diachronic changes? To address this question, I first describe the distributional patterns of the Spanish copulas with a wide range of predicate types, along with prior observations suggesting variation in copular use. Then, I present the boundedness-presupposition analysis, which relies on methodological tools from model-theoretic semantics and conceptual semantics, to account for the range of uses of estar and the variability in copula use. The analysis locates the differences between the copulas in the presuppositional component of estar, which is not present in ser. The presuppositional component is experimentally tested in four dialects of Spanish (Argentinian, Iberian, Mexican and Venezuelan) using four different methodologies: 1) an acceptability-rating questionnaire, 2) a fill-in-the-blank task, 3) a self-paced reading study and 4) an EEG/ERP study. The main finding from this investigation is that copula acceptability and use can be contextually modulated. Specifically, estar sentences increase in acceptability and are less costly to process when preceded by contextual information that satisfies estar ‹s pressupositional component. The EEG/ERP data provide a finer-grained understanding of the interactions between the lexical meaning of estar and the contextual information as the sentence unfolds. A main conclusion from this dissertation is that the variation observed in copula use in Modern Spanish can be understood as a manifestation of the diachronic development of encroachment of estar. The variation in copula use across dialects is a reflection of the different stages of development of estar’s encroachment, with certain dialects (Mexican and Venezuelan Spanish) being further ahead in the process of encroachment than others (Iberian and Argentinian Spanish.) The dissertation concludes that it is this additional information provided by estar that speakers exploit over time and that serves as a driver of encroachment of estar over time.},

In these types of relative clause, what looks like a (pivot) head noun appears at the left edge of the clause and is accompanied by no and de, respectively. This sharply contrasts with regular prenominal relative clauses in Japanese, which conform to the head-final word order pattern. The aim of this article is to investigate the syntax and semantics of these two types of relative clause in detail and reveal differences between them. Specifically, I will propose that (i) no in No-RCs is an appositive genitive particle licensed by a silent linker head, and (ii) de in De-RCs is a continuative/participial form of the copula da. Drawing a parallel with NP-no NP constructions and building on an idea from S.-Y. Kuroda’s dissertation, it will be argued that No-RCs are derived by DP-internal inversion mediated by the linker. On the other hand, De-RCs will be shown to be relatives conjoined with the copula de. It will be further suggested that the fact that Korean and Mandarin Chinese lack equivalents of De-RCs is due to the absence of the appositive genitive particle and hence of DP-internal inversion.},

This renders suspect both `specificational analyses', on which the cleft clause both semantically and syntactically modifies it, and `expletive analyses', on which the cleft clause and clefted XP are both semantically and syntactically composed directly. I provide new evidence for Hedberg’s type of analysis. The first set of evidence suggests that cleft it is non-expletive, thus arguing in favour of treating it and the cleft clause as a discontinuous definite description. The second set of evidence shows that, with respect to various tests, the cleft clause behaves as if the clefted XP, rather than it, is its antecedent.},

In recent years it has become popular to assume that not only action verbs but predicates of all sorts have an additional event argument. Yet, this hypothesis is not without controversy in particular with respect to the particularly challenging case of statives. Maienborn (2003, 2005b) argues that there is a need for distinguishing two kinds of states. While verbs such as sit, stand, sleep refer to eventualities in the sense of Davidson (= Davidsonian states), the states denoted by such Stative verbs like know, weigh, and own, as well as any combination of copula plus predicate are of a different ontological type (= Kimian states). Against this background, the present study assesses the two main arguments that have been raised in favour of a Davidsonian approach for statives. These are the combination with certain manner adverbials and Parsons' (2000) so-called time travel argument. It will be argued that the manner data which, at first sight, seem to provide evidence for a Davidsonian approach to statives are better analysed as non-compositional reinterpretations triggered by the lack of a regular Davidsonian event argument. As for Parsons’s time travel argument, it turns out that the original version does not supply the kind of support for the Davidsonian approach that Parsons supposed. However, properly adapted, the time travel argument may provide additional evidence for the need of reifying the denotatum of statives, as suggested by the assumption of Kimian states.},

It is shown that the subject of these questions is of the type of individual concepts ({$<$,s, e$>$t$>$}) and that it must contain a referential expression that anchors it to the context of utterance. The subject of a specificational care -question is generally definite; it can be indefinite just in case the question contains a subjective predicate and the copula is in the conditional mood. We show that an indefinite noun phrase cannot be the subject of a constituent question unless the question has a topic other than the subject. We argue that the point of view argument of a subjective predicate can function as a sentence topic. Therefore, if specificational care -question contain a subjective predicate, they allow an indefinite subject since they have a non-subject topic.},

In SPCs with the order XP < be < wh-clause (Type B), XP (=DP, VP, AP, PP or CP) is not reduced from IP by ellipsis, but forms the subject of a copular sentence whose predicate is the wh-clause.

year = {2005}, 
abstract = {AbstractThe study offers a discourse-based account of the Spanish copula forms ser and estar, which are generally considered to be lexical exponents of the stage-level/individual-level contrast. It argues against the popular view that the distinction between SLPs and ILPs rests on a fundamental cognitive division of the world that is reflected in the grammar. As it happens, conceptual oppositions like ”temporary vs. permanent or ”arbitrary vs. essential provide only a preference for the interpretation of estar and ser. In addition, the evidence for an SLP/ILP impact on the grammar turns out to be far less conclusive than is currently assumed. The study argues against event-based accounts of the ser/estar contrast in particular, showing that ser and estar pattern alike in failing all of the standard eventuality tests. The discourse-based account proposed instead assumes that ser and estar both display the same lexical semantics (which is identical to the semantics of English be, German sein, etc.); estar diers from ser only in presupposing a relation to a specific discourse situation. By using estar a speaker restricts his or her claim to a specific discourse situation, whereas by using ser, the speaker makes no such restriction. The preference for interpreting estar predications as denoting temporary properties and ser predications as denoting permanent properties follows from economy principles driving the pragmatic legitimation of estar’s discourse dependence. The analysis proposed in this article can also account for the observation that ser predications do not give rise to thetic judgments. The proposal is couched in terms of the framework of DRT.},

Over the past years Davidson’s proposal has been continuously extended such that nowadays event(uality) arguments are generally associated not only with action verbs but with predicates of all sorts. The reasons for such an extension are seldom explicitly justified. Most problematical in this respect is the case of stative expressions. By taking a closer look at copula sentences the present study assesses the legitimacy of stretching the Davidsonian notion of events and discusses its consequences. A careful application of some standard eventuality diagnostics (perception reports, combination with locative modifiers and manner adverbials) as well as some new diagnostics (behavior of certain degree adverbials) reveals that copular expressions do not behave as expected under a Davidsonian perspective: they fail all eventuality tests, regardless of whether they represent stage-level or individual-level predicates. In this respect, copular expressions pattern with stative verbs like know, hate, and resemble, which in turn differ sharply from state verbs like stand, sit, and sleep. The latter pass all of the eventuality tests and therefore qualify as true ”Davidsonian},

Following Kornfilt (1996) I argue that there are two verbal forms in finite structures: one consists of a participle and a copula, which is inflected for tense and agreement, and the other is a fully inflected verbal form. I propose that the former is formed by a derivation in which the verb moves as far as a functional head such Aspect or Modal, creating a participle. A verbal feature (copula) is inserted at T⁰ satisfying its verbal requirement. In the latter case the verb moves all the way up to T⁰. No copula is inserted. The rest of the dissertation focuses on the interaction between structure and quantificational elements. One question addressed is why indefinites marked overtly for accusative case violate scope rigidity, and are interpreted as having wide scope over quantificational elements c-commanding them. It is argued that they do not violate scope rigidity, but rather the unexpected wide scope interpretation is the result of a special interpretative mechanism.},

Prior work in building probabilistic models for predicting the presence of agreement or non-agreement in any given such there+be sentential context has investigated a variety of factors with potential influence on this variation, but the present study provides evidence for the inclusion of two novel and significantly predictive elements: a plurality ‹cue distance' and a new taxonomy for determiner type.

Second, the question arises as to whether the unexpected invariance of certain adjectives can be explained in terms of the effects of additional functional categories.

We assume that the comparison class is introduced by the degree morphology of the adjective and present a new proposal where comparison classes are crucial to explain the distribution of adjectives in Spanish copular sentences headed by the verbs ser `beSER' and estar `beESTAR'. The copula estar `be estar ‹ appears whenever a gradable adjective merges with a within-individual comparison class, a modifier expressing a property of stages. The copular verb ser `be ser ‹ appears when a gradable adjective merges with a between-individuals comparison class, a modifier expressing a property of individuals. The distinction between relative and absolute adjectives can be reduced to the semantic properties of the modifier expressing the comparison class that is merged in the functional structure of the adjective.},

In this article, we present two experimental studies on Puerto Rican children’s use of copulas and show that when novel adjectives are paired with novel properties and those novel adjectives occur in the experimental prompt with the copula estar, children associate the novel adjective to a temporary property by 4 years of age.

Van Craenenbroeck and Lipták (2013) propose that whether a language exhibits genuine sluicing should be predictable from the syntax of the language’s wh-questions in nonelliptical contexts. We refine this formulation by considering SLCs in two contrasting wh-in-situ languages, Hindi-Urdu and Uzbek. Hindi-Urdu wh-movement occurs in the narrow syntax, but is obscured by PF processes; in Uzbek, no narrow syntax dependency is involved. Correspondingly, only Hindi-Urdu SLCs involve genuine sluicing; Uzbek SLCs are derived from reduced copular clauses. Thus, narrow syntax wh-movement may be obscured by lower-copy pronunciation in nonelliptical environments; the head of the wh-chain is then pronounced in combination with ellipsis, but not otherwise. Here, we demonstrate that the availability of genuine sluicing in Hindi-Urdu and Uzbek corresponds directly to the specific properties of their wh-systems, but not necessarily to the surface position of wh-material in a typical constituent question.},

Despite the absence of c-command in the surface syntax, specificational pseudoclefts yield interpretations that are governed by c-command in other constructions. The present study focused on two kinds of specificational pseudoclefts (SPCs). In one, a wh-clause with a pronoun precedes the copula and then a phrase containing an R-expression expression (e.g. What he said was the blue boy’s wheelchair was the fastest). Principle C effects (noncoreference) are enforced despite the absence of surface c-command. In the second type of SPC, a disjunctive phrase precedes the copula and a wh-clause that contains a negative quantifier (e.g. A shell or a jewel is what nobody brought back). Here, despite lack of surface c-command between negation and the disjunction, disjunction yields a conjunctive interpretation. Both kinds of SPCs pose a poverty-of-the-stimulus problem; how do children come to assign adult-like interpretations to SPCs, when the surface syntax does not provide relevant clues to semantic interpretation? A truth value judgment task revealed that 17 4--5 year-old English-speaking child participants (mean age 4;8) consistently interpreted both kinds of SPCs in the same way as adults, enforcing both Principle C and the conjunctive interpretation of disjunction.},

One of these unstudied semi-copulas is French se faire (`become'), a pronominal verb taking a subject complement. It can be considered a product of the conjoined action of lexicalization and grammaticalization of the reflexive construction. Although its basic meaning is aspectual, expressing a change of state (`become'), it is nowadays developing a non-dynamic meaning, involving no change of state at all. This paper addresses two central questions:(i) what is the exact meaning effect of se faire compared to other evidential semi-copulas such as sembler and para\$^{\itre? (ii) how does this usage relate to the other usages of this multilayered verb and how exactly is subjectification taking place? As to (i), it will be shown that, although se faire expresses indirect evidentiality based on inference, it does not express appearance, unlike verbs such as `seem'. Rather, it has a factive meaning that comes rather close to what has been called direct evidentiality. As to (ii), it will be argued that, in a first stage, se faire has been increasingly used in contexts that display subjective perspectivation of the change of state. Then, it has lost its dynamic meaning by means of the mechanism of virtual change. On the whole, this evolution attests a new subjectification path leading from aspect (change of state) to evidentiality, which, interestingly, is confirmed by the Spanish cognate verb hacerse (`become').},

The article reviews previous accounts, presents the complex data, and categorizes most cases of extra be into one unified syntactic construction, the shared shell-noun construction. It is argued that such constructions are syntactically fairly ordinary biclausal specificational copular sentences, consisting of a setup clause and a resolution clause, which share an argument.

The aim of this paper is to account for the conditions under which this entailment of direct experience appears. More specifically, I argue that it is the result of an interpretive, inferential solution triggered to solve a feature mismatch between the semantic requirements of the copula estar and the semantic properties of individual-level adjectival predicates. The evidential commitment is added to provide a situational anchor for the estar predication when the adjectival predicate is unbounded. The approach presented here has implications for our view on commitment and evidentiality, and can cast some light on the issue of copula selection in Spanish.},

We put forth the following generalization: Whenever imperfective aspect interacts with SC, two possible readings arise, one that is purely abilitative and another one that expresses an accidental or unpredictable state of affairs. Our claim is that both interpretations derive from a circumstantial modal base that includes the subject’s inner circumstances, albeit with a different ordering source that is brought about via the interaction of imperfective aspect and the syntax-semantics of the modal. Thus, we propose that the purely abilitative SC contains an ordering source that ranks as better worlds those in which the subject appeals to her strength of the body, intellect or character; the accidental reading is the result of covert movement of the adjective capaz `capable' over the imperfective-bearing copula ser `be', which triggers a change of ordering source in the modal.},

abstract = {The central thesis of this work is that a clause consisting only of left-peripheral functional structure can be fully finite. Generative models of clause structure typically assume that a finite clause must be tensed, including a projection of T and a temporal relation between the proposition and the utterance context. In light of evidence from tenseless languages, this assumption has come under scrutiny in recent years. This dissertation offers a new body of evidence from English, a tensed language, in support of the claim that finite clauses can lack the projection of T. Drawing on the results of formal acceptability experiments, this dissertation presents an original investigation of the understudied family of specificational copular amalgam sentences (e.g., She wrote about finiteness is what she did), which differs from canonical specificational copular sentences with respect to a number of syntactic and semantic properties. The most salient of these properties is the occurrence of a root clause in the role of logical and structural subject. I propose that copular amalgam sentences are finite, but their functional spine consists only of the C-domain, lacking projections of T and V. Since C-domain heads can project in the absence of T and V, there can be no implicational relation between higher and lower heads in the functional sequence. Copular amalgams show that finiteness can be reduced to phenomena originating in the left periphery of the clause. These phenomena include [T] and [phi] inflection, the licensing of an independently referential subject, and independent anchoring of the proposition to the utterance context. Independent anchoring, which is typically conflated with temporal anchoring in the T domain, obtains via deixis to the utterance context in finite clauses that lack T. This dissertation has two main contributions: to catalogue the properties of a typologically rare, yet understudied construction, and to challenge the Extended Projections model of the clause.},

I argue that the three constructions share a meaning along the lines of `P2(a), and from this it is possible to infer that P1(a)', where P1 is forced to receive the transitory interpretation, but they differ as to which component they assert/presuppose. I further demonstrate that this analysis allows us to solve two well-known semantic puzzles concerning these constructions (the `entailment puzzle' and the `embeddability puzzle'). The three constructions are highly amenable to the Construction Grammar approach, because their meaning cannot be derived from the intuitive meanings of their constituents and regular semantic rules only.

Our starting point is the alternation between NP1 and NP2 agreement, which arises both within and across languages. This alternation is typically taken to be confined to specificational (i.e. inverted) clauses, and previous analyses have strongly identified NP2 agreement with the syntax of inversion. However, we show that NP2 agreement is attested in a broader range of contexts, specifically in (assumed identity) equative structures, suggesting that it should not be correlated with specificational syntax. We present contrasting data from two languages -- Persian and Eastern Armenian -- for which the syntax of copular clauses is understudied. Whereas in Persian we see NP2 agreement in specificational structures but NP1 agreement in assumed identity equatives, in Eastern Armenian both types of structure yield NP2 agreement. We argue that the contrast between Persian and Eastern Armenian supports an approach that takes the NP1--NP2 alternation to arise as a phi-sensitivity in the probe--goal mechanics of Agree in a minimalist framework. Under this view, NP2 agreement is independent of syntactic inversion and is the result of the probe structure being articulated in such a way that certain NPs fail to Agree.},

abstract = {In a variety of languages a particle, which we call the linker, appears between the direct object and a secondary object or nominal adpositional phrase. We compare the syntax of this linker particle in Kinande (Niger-Congo) to its syntax in two Khoisan languages, {Ju}{\textbar}’hoansi and {\textdoublebarpipe Hoan}. We propose an account of the properties that linkers in these languages share, including the linkers’word order properties and Case-theoretic contributions. We then go on to explore the range of variation that the linker construction tolerates, with respect to what phrases can move into the linker’s specifier, and whether or not the linker manifests agreement with its specifier. In so doing, we uncover both the principles and the parameters relevant to these linker constructions. Finally, we point to some evidence that the linker category even exists in Chichewa (and other Bantu languages) in which it is not spelled out overtly. Our analysis provides striking support for the existence of v P-internal functional projections. The data in this paper also lead us to the surprising conclusion that the Minimal Link Condition can be parameterized.},

journal = {Linguistics}, 
volume = {}, 
number = {}, 
pages = {}, 
year = {2019}, 
abstract = {The aim of this Article is to propose that fragment answers in Basaá (Bantu) derive from two different sources, namely, a regular source and a copular source. Regular fragments are those that are derived by movement of a Negative Polarity Item (NPI) or a CP complement to the left periphery of the clause followed by clausal ellipsis (Merchant 2004 and related work). Conversely, copular fragments involve a biclausal structure whereby the focalized fragment, no matter the syntactic function it fulfills in clause structure, finally ends up being the subject of the null verbal copula of the main clause. The fragment is initially selected as the external argument of the null verbal copula within the matrix VP along the lines of the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis (Koopman and Sportiche 1991). From Spec-VP it raises to Spec-TP to satisfy the EPP requirements. The internal argument of the null copula is a headless relative in which a relative operator (covert/overt) moves to Spec-CP, a position above FocP the target of ellipsis. This gives rise to a structure whereby the fragment answer in the matrix clause and the relative operator in the embedded clause resist ellipsis. The analysis also provides semantic evidence that copular fragments are not clefts. The ellipsis approach is supported by a range of grammatical properties such as connectivity effects, locality constraints and subcategorization requirements. This paper is not only a contribution to Merchant’s (2004) ellipsis approach but it also provides new evidence for our understanding of the crosslinguistic variation of ellipsis.},

abstract = {[This paper investigates the syntax of a class of copular sentences in Modern Irish which have posed a longstanding problem in that they differ from other finite clauses in the language in word order and other significant syntactic properties. The paper argues that the ‹copula' in question is a non-lexical category, a functional head of the inflectional class. This conclusion forms the basis for an analysis of the major syntactic anomalies of the construction which makes no recourse to language-specific phrase structure rules. A significant property of the proposed analysis is that it is not reconcilable with the common background assumption that functional heads are limited to one category of complement (Abney 1987, Grimshaw 1991): the Irish copula is one documented example of a functional head which admits a wide range of categories in its complement. Furthermore, the paper argues that the traditional observation that these sentences admit only predicates expressive of a permanent property can be profitably re-interpreted in terms of the individual-level/stage-level distinction (Carlson 1977, Kratzer 1989).]},

This article proposes the first analysis of such ``summative›› readings of existentials, premised on a novel semantics for cardinal determiners as counting the values of an individual concept across indices. The analysis is shown to predict the observed descriptive generalizations about summative existentials, including the highly restricted circumstances that give rise to them. The unorthodox semantics proposed for cardinals is argued to be independently motivated.},
